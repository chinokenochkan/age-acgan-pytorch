# Age-Conditioned Synthesis of Pediatric Computed Tomography with Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks

This is the official implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00011) "Age-Conditioned Synthesis of Pediatric Computed Tomography with Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks" in PyTorch.

## Training

To run training with default parameters from root directory: 
`python main.py`

To run testing:
`python main.py --testing=True`

Training samples are saved under `output/` and loss values are logged in `logs/`
